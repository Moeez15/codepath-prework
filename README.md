## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. TikTok
- Easy video creation and editing tools
- Algorithm that quickly adapts to user interests

2. Snapchat
- Disappearing messages and Snaps for privacy
- Fun and creative filters/lenses
- Streaks and Bitmoji interactions with friends

3. Disoord
- Organized servers with channels for focused conversations
- Screen sharing and video calls for collaboration or gaming

I’d like to build an app called StudyLink, designed to help students connect with others in their classes, dorms, or with similar study interests. 
The app would allow users to create a profile based on their university, major, and current courses. Key features would include group chatrooms for 
each course, a study session scheduler, and the ability to find study partners nearby using filters like subject, availability, and location (e.g., same 
dorm or library). I’d also like to include reminders for upcoming exams or assignments based on shared course data. This app would make studying more 
collaborative and less stressful.

## Notes

One of the main challenges I faced while building the app was that it was my first time using Swift and Xcode. I had to learn the basics of the Swift 
programming language, how to design user interfaces using Interface Builder, and how to connect UI elements to code using IBActions.
